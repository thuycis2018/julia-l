      content:
        "async function: When a function is marked with the async keyword, it automatically returns a Promise, even if you donâ€™t explicitly return a Promise in the function. The value returned from the function is wrapped in a resolved Promise. await: The await keyword is used to pause the execution of an async function until the Promise that it is waiting for is settled (either resolved or rejected). It essentially unwraps the value of a resolved Promise so that you can work with it as if it were synchronous.",

      content:
        "You can break your async operations into smaller groups (or chunks) and run them concurrently, controlling the number of simultaneous operations. This can be helpful if you don't want to overwhelm your database or API by sending too many requests at once.",
